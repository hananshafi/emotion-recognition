# Emotion-Recognition
Keras code for Emotion Recognition using Facial Expresions. 
The code contains a Standard Convolutional Neural Network that detects 5 different types of Emotions in Humans: sad, happy, angry, surprise and Neutral 


# Dataset
 The dataset used is the Facial Expression Recognition (FER) dataset from Kaggle.

# Training
open the Emotion recognition jupyter notebook, specify the apprpriate paths for Images and csv file. Run the training. After the training is finished, the model will get saved as model.json and weights will be saved as modelfer.h5

# Load model for real time detection
Open the load model jupyter notebook (loadmodel.ipynb) and provide the paths for saved model and weights. Run the notebook.
